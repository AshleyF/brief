# 02 JUL 2023 Brief Lisp

I'm back, after a long hiatus! Currently, I'm thinking about how to integrate a Forth-like language such as Brief (postfix, fixed arity) with the Lisp family of languages (prefix, variadic). I've spent the day rereading this journal and rereading my old blog series from 2007 on [FScheme; a Scheme in F#.](https://github.com/AshleyF/FScheme/blob/master/README.md).

I think it might be interesting to have a Brief postfix syntax for constructing s-expressions that are then envaluated with Lisp semantics. I'm also thinking that a Haskell-esque lazy Lisp with no special forms would be very interesting. Maybe even expose the Brief continuation with something like Scheme's `call/cc`. Let's play with all the tricks!
