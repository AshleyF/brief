# 13 NOV 2021 Raw Processing

I decided to change `Raw` to a simple `byte[]`, rather than describing a section of a larger buffer. This is less efficient, but more concrete -- just for now.

# 14 NOV 2021 What Was I Thinking?!

I don't know what I was thinking with all the `Raw` stuff. I ended up creating versions of `cons` and `snoc` to work with `Raw` and started making binary parsing words... I even thought of adding syntax to the language (e.g. 4-bytes `<deadc0de>`).

Then I thought, *what the heck*, we already have all this infrastructure for dealing with `Lists`; `cons`, `snoc`, `compose`, not to mention `map`, `filter`, `fold`, ... Then I thought of adding a `Byte` primitive type, but decided to simply treat them as `Numbers`.

I've changed `load` and `store` to accept and return `Lists` of `Numbers` representing the bytes. Easy as that!

# 15 NOV 2021 Undo

The interpreter is conviently built atop immutable types. It was *very* easy to maintain a list of historical states before applying each line of input in the interpreter. At the interpreter level, I added an `undo` command (similar to `exit` -- not a word, but a special command understood directly by the REPL). This will roll back state. It's quite convenient. I didn't realize how often I'd do a `dup` just to preserve the top of the stack while I tested something out. This preserves the *entire* state.
